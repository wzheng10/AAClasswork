Fixing Git Commit AUthorship
1. Create a backup branch - that was if something goes wrong, you can always get back to your original state
    git branch wrong-author
2. Run the command in terminal from within your repo's root directory
git filter-branch -f --env-filter "GIT_AUTHOR_NAME='your_full_name'; GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL='your_email'; GIT_COMMITTER_NAME='your_full_name'; GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL='your_email';" HEAD
3. If you've already pushed your repo to GitHub , then add -f to git push to force push all your commites
